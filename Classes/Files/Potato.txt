Following the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe in the second half of the 16th century, part of the Columbian exchange. 
The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners (possibly including Russian-American Company) to territories and ports throughout the world, especially their colonies.[24] 
The potato was slow to be adopted by European and colonial farmers, but after 1750 it became an important food staple and field crop[24] and 
played a major role in the European 19th century population boom.[20] According to conservative estimates, 
the introduction of the potato was responsible for a quarter of the growth in Old World population and urbanization between 1700 and 1900.[25] 
However, lack of genetic diversity, due to the very limited number of varieties initially introduced, left the crop vulnerable to disease. 
In 1845, a plant disease known as late blight, caused by the fungus-like oomycete Phytophthora infestans, 
spread rapidly through the poorer communities of western Ireland as well as parts of the Scottish Highlands, resulting in the crop failures that led to the Great Irish Famine.[26][24

The International Potato Center, based in Lima, Peru, holds 4,870 types of potato germplasm, most of which are traditional landrace cultivars.[27]
 The international Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium announced in 2009 that they had achieved a draft sequence of the potato genome, 
 containing 12 chromosomes and 860 million base pairs, making it a medium-sized plant genome.[28] 
 More than 99% of all current varieties of potatoes currently grown are direct descendants of a subspecies that once grew in the lowlands of south-central Chile.[29] 
 Nonetheless, genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species affirms that all potato subspecies derive from a single origin in the area of present-day southern Peru
  and extreme Northwestern Bolivia (from a species in the S. brevicaule complex).[18][19][20]

Most modern potatoes grown in North America arrived through European settlement and not independently from the South American sources, 
although at least one wild potato species, S. fendleri, occurs in North America, where it is used in breeding for resistance to a nematode species that attacks cultivated potatoes. 
A secondary center of genetic variability of the potato is Mexico, where important wild species that have been used extensively in modern breeding are found, such as the hexaploid S. 
demissum, as a source of resistance to the devastating late blight disease (Phytophthora infestans).[26]
 Another relative native to this region, Solanum bulbocastanum, has been used to genetically engineer the potato to resist potato blight.[30] 
 Many such wild relatives are useful for breeding resistance to P. infestans.[31]

Little of the diversity found in Solanum ancestral and wild relative is found outside of the original South American range.[32] 
This makes these South American species highly valuable in breeding.[32]
